Tiur is a static documentation site generator written in Python.

In ancient Armenia, Tiur was revered as the god of wisdom, rhetoric, knowledge, and the arts. He was revered as the scribe and messenger of the supreme god Aramazd.

The philosophy of Tiur is simple:

* It is an aggregator of static HTML files 
* It is fast and simple to deploy
* It can import multiple repositories and organize them in one site
* It can handle authentication for both the site and the repositories
* It provides automatic, built-in search
